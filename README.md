# DS-Early-Progress-Report

This is a capstone project from The Data Incubator Fellowship.  

One of the main interests of the universities administrative offices is the Early Alert Progress Report. The universities want to know whether students will pass or fail at the earlier stage of the semester.

This project uses the logistic regression to predict the students' success at the end of the semester from student's performance at the earlier stage.
